# Image Classification Training

General Information: The script in this repository uses tensorflow and keras to perform image classification machine learning to train a convolutional nueral network to classify images into 2 categories: images with faces and images without faces. This script also saves models and logs to be used later after loading onto the Raspberry PI.
